# 🎬 MauiVLCPlayer

A cross-platform .NET MAUI app using **LibVLCSharp** to play MP4 and HLS video streams. Built with **Visual Studio 2022** and **.NET 8**, this project demonstrates how to integrate VLC’s powerful media engine into a modern mobile/desktop UI.

Please note this is very basic and only a way for you to get started i spenk weeks trying to get this far Maui is still very experimental in my opinon. I thought it would be nice to share what I learned here.
I plann on continuing with controls and things and cossider this to be part 1. Stay tuned for Part 2.
